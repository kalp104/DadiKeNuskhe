       <h4> People have used ginger in cooking and medicine since antiquity. It remains a popular home remedy for nausea, stomach pain, and other health issues. </h4>
       <br>
       <img class="image" src="SGP_IMAGES/ginger.jpg">
       <h3>People typically use fresh or dried ginger in cooking or herbal tea, and some take ginger supplements for their possible health benefits.</h3>
        <br>
       <h3>Ginger root comes from the Zingiber officinale plant, and it has been used in Chinese and Indian medicine for thousands of yearsTrusted Source. <br> <br>

        Ginger may help relieveTrusted Source nausea and vomiting and aid digestionTrusted Source. Antioxidants and other nutrients in ginger root may help prevent or treat arthritis, inflammation, and various types of infection. Ginger may also reduce the risk of diabetes, cancer, and other health problems.</h3>
        <h3>In this article, learn more about these and other possible health benefits of ginger, and the research behind them.</h3>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>


      <div class="Benefits">
           <h3> Reducing gas and improving digestion</h3>
           <p> According to a 2018 reviewTrusted Source, several studies have investigated ginger’s effects on the gasses that form in the intestinal tract during digestion. This research indicates that enzymes in ginger can help break up and expel this gas, providing relief from any discomfort.

          <br><br>  In addition, the research shows that ginger may help increase movement through the digestive tract, suggesting that it may relieve or prevent constipation.</p>
      <p>Ginger also appears to have beneficial effectsTrusted Source on the enzyme pancreatic lipase, which aids digestion in the small intestine.</p>
       
<br><br>
      <h3> Relieving nausea</h3>
           <p> A 2020 review indicates that ginger can help alleviate morning sickness and relieve nausea following cancer treatment. <br><br>

            A 2016 review suggests that the odor-producing principles gingerols and shogaols are effective in preventing nausea and vomiting. However, the amounts of those compounds can vary, depending on the form of ginger. The researchers determined that dried ginger, followed by fresh ginger and powdered ginger tea had the highest concentrations of gingerol.  <br><br>
            
            One study that the review analyzed included 576 adult cancer patients. The scientists found that doses of 0.5 grams (g) and 1.0 g were most effective at reducing nausea.  <br><br>
            
            Of the seven studies analyzed, five showed ginger to be beneficial, while two found no beneficial outcomes. The authors of the review suggest that the mixed results may stem from differences in the forms and preparations of ginger. <br><br>
            
            They also called for further studies in humans, in order to fully understand the effects of ginger on nausea and other gastrointestinal issues. </p>
    
    
            <h3> Reducing inflammation</h3>
            <p> A 2015 review concluded that taking ginger by mouth is “modestly efficacious and reasonably safe” for treating inflammation caused by osteoarthritis.  <br><br>

              However, the authors noted that the studies in their meta-analysis were small and may not represent the general population. <br><br>
              
              Meanwhile, a 2017 review of 16 clinical trials determined that the phytochemical properties in ginger may combat inflammation. These authors also called for further research into the most effective dosages and types of ginger extract.</p>
     
              <h3>Relieving pain</h3>
              <p>Ginger may easeTrusted Source pain through anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of its gingerol compounds. <br><br>
 
                A 2016 review concluded that ginger may specifically help reduce dysmenorrhea — pain right before or during a period. However, the authors acknowledge that the studies they had reviewed were often small or of poor quality. <br><br>
                
                Fully exploring a connection between ginger consumption and pain relief will require more research.</p>

       <h3> The FDA considers ginger to be safe in the diet, but it does not guarantee or regulate its use as a medicine or supplement. <br><br>

        ResearchersTrusted Source have not investigated many of the compounds in ginger. Also, scientific evidence does not support some claims about ginger’s healing qualities.
        <br><br>
        Before adding more ginger to the diet or taking a ginger supplement, consult a healthcare professional. Some supplements can interact with medications or cause other health complications. </h3>

<h3>Currently, garlic is widely used for several conditions linked to the blood system and heart, including atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), high cholesterol, heart attack, coronary heart disease, and hypertension.</h3>

<h3>Garlic is also used today by some people for the prevention of lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer, rectal cancer, and colon cancer.</h3>

<h3>It is important to add that only some of these uses are backed by research.</h3>

<h3>A study published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology warned that short-term heating reduces the anti-inflammatory effects of fresh raw garlic extracts. This may be a problem for some people who do not like or cannot tolerate the taste and/or odor of fresh garlic.</h3>
